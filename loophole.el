;;; Commentary:

;; Loophole provides temporary key bindings management feature.
;; Keys can be set by interactive interface in disposable keymaps
;; which are automatically generated for temporary use.

;; Run `loophole-mode' to setup Loophole.
;; Call `loophole-set-key' to set a temporary key binding.
;; See https://github.com/0x60df/loophole/blob/master/README.md for datails.

Loophole mode offers temporary key bindings management
utilities; key bindings for Loophole commands, mode-line

work correctly without Loophole mode.

When Loophole mode is enabled, Loophole is basically
resumed.  Then, active Loophole maps take effect; in other
words, you can use key bindings bound in keymaps which are
registered to Loophole and whose state is non-nil.

For the details of mode-line lighter, see documentation

an alist of which element looks like (KEY . ENTRY).
If SPEC is evaluated as nil, make sparse keymap.
Otherwise, emit error signal.

Define state variable by STATE, STATE-INIT-VALUE and

If STATE-DOCSTRING is nil, use fixed phrase.
