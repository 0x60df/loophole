;;; Commentary:

;; Loophole provides temporary key bindings management feature.
;; Keys can be set by interactive interface in disposable keymaps
;; which are automatically generated for temporary use.

;; Run `loophole-mode' to setup Loophole.
;; Call `loophole-set-key' to set a temporary key binding.
;; See https://github.com/0x60df/loophole/blob/master/README.md for datails.

This list may contain buffers which are dead or no longer
having no local variables, because Loophole mode cannot
recognize some special cases on which buffer or local
variables are killed silently.
Instead of refering this variable directly, use the function
`loophole-buffer-list' to safely get buffers which are live
and having local variables.")

Loophole binds keys in this keymap.  When this value is nil,
Loophole may generate new keymap and bind keys in it.

If default value of this variable is t, editing session is
local, and buffer local values are used; otherwise, editing
session is global, and default value is used.

Use function `loophole-editing' to get the value of this
variable.
You should not set this variable directly, instead use
`loophole-start-editing'.")

This function usually starts `recursive-edit', to give user

Typing `loophole-read-buffer-finish-key' finishes writing

Typing `loophole-read-buffer-abort-key' aborts it.

If user option `loophole-read-buffer-inhibit-recursive-edit'
is non-nil, this function set up some utilities and `signal'
quit.  One of the utilities is a binidng
`loophole-read-buffer-finish-key' with a command which calls
CALLBACK with one argument a read form.
By these utilities, user can use the buffer as well as using
`recursive-edit' while released from `recursive-edit'.
To allow user to choose inhibiting `recursive-edit',
CALLBACK must be defined.

If optional argument BUFFER is non-nil and is an alive
buffer, use it instead of current buffer."

  "Register the set of MAP-VARIABLE and STATE-VARIABLE to Loophole.
Optional argument TAG is a tag string which may be shown in
mode line.  TAG should not contain `loophole-tag-sign',
because tag may be prefixed by `loophole-tag-sign' on the
mode-line.

If optional argument GLOBAL is non-nil, MAP-VARIABLE and
STATE-VARIABLE are registered as globalized Loophole map.
It means that STATE-VARIABLE must not be marked as
`make-variable-buffer-local'.  If marked, this function ask
user if `unintern' STATE-VARIABLE is acceptable.
If answer is yes, STATE-VARIABLE is uninterned and interned
again.  Value, function and plist of STATE-VARIABLE are
ported to newly interned STATE-VARIABLE.
Otherwise, register is aborted safely.

On the other hand, if STATE-VARIABLE is not marked as
`make-variable-buffer-local', and GLOBAL is nil,
this function ask user if `make-variable-buffer-local'
STATE-VARIABLE is acceptable.
These query can be skipped with yes by setting t to
`loophole-force-make-variable-buffer-local' and
`loophole-force-unintern'.

Unless WITHOUT-BASE-MAP is non-nil, `loophole-base-map' is
set as parent keymap for MAP-VARIABLE.
If parent of keymap of MAP-VARIABLE is non-nil when setting
parent keymap, composed keymap is made from exisiting parent
and `loophole-base-map'.
Because `loophole-unregister' assumes that a keymap parent
has a form described above, if other feature modifies keymap
parent, `loophole-unregister' cannot remove
`loophole-base-map' properly.

Furthermore, Loophole uses parent keymap for protected
keymap entry.  Therefore, if other feature modifies keymap
parent of registered Loophole map, some entries may be
corrupted.
Be careful especially when registering keymaps controlled by
the feature other than Loophole.

If called interactively, read MAP-VARIABLE, STATE-VARIABLE.
When called with prefix argument, read TAG and ask user if
MAP-VARIABLE is registered as GLOBAL and WITHOUT-BASE-MAP."

Loophole mode offers temporary key bindings management
utilities; key bindings for Loophole commands, mode-line
lighter, and performance support, though Loophole commands
work correctly without Loophole mode.

When Loophole mode is enabled, Loophole is basically
resumed.  Then, active Loophole maps take effect; in other
words, you can use key bindings bound in keymaps which are
registered to Loophole and whose state is non-nil.

For the details of mode-line lighter, see documentation
string of `loophole-mode-lighter'.

Followings are the key bindings for Loophole commands.

  "Macro for defining loophole map.
Define map variable and state variable, and register them.

Define map variable by MAP, SPEC and DOCSTRING.
If SPEC is evaluated as keymap, use it as init value of
MAP.  If SPEC is evaluated as list, this macro expect it as
an alist of which element looks like (KEY . ENTRY).
If SPEC is evaluated as nil, make sparse keymap.
Otherwise, emit error signal.
DOCSTRING is passed to `defvar'.

Define state variable by STATE, STATE-INIT-VALUE and
STATE-DOCSTRING.
If STATE is literal nil or omitted, define variable named as
MAP-state.
STATE-INIT-VALUE is used as it is.
If STATE-DOCSTRING is nil, use fixed phrase.
If GLOBAL is literal nil or omitted,
`make-variable-buffer-local' for state-variable is added to
expanded forms.

TAG, GLOBAL and WITHOUT-BASE-MAP are passed to
`loophole-register'."
